/**
 * This class holds any information we might want to communicate with the
 * retrieval model we are implementing about a specific document
 *
 * This essential representation just holds the important things.
 *
 * Can also be extended by another class, like the DocInfoFull, that will be
 * used whenever we want to get all information related with a document, i.e.
 * all information in the entry of a document in the Documents file
 *
 * Since probably we are going to store in memory a lot of these objects, we
 * have to be as memory efficient as we can. This implementation with a map is
 * worst than just keeping all properties as primitives and private members but
 * seems to be simpler to interact with
 *
 * ID and offset in document file are set only in the constructor
